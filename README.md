# Shipment tracking

this is a shipment tracking application can be used for drivers to select a shipment by it's ID after they submit a form by their name and phone number then this form save their information into the database. then we could track every shipment with it's live location tracker.


## About

I used Firebase anonymous authentication so that the driver can log in the application, and Firbase cloud database to store the application data, like users informations and shipments and although tracking information ofor every shipments. 

I have applied clean architecture principles in the code and although with organizing the project files.

Alhough i used BloC as statemangment and Google maps services to get the location and track the shipments.  



## Dependencies:

- Statemangment --> BLoC
- Authentication --> Firebase authentication
- Database --> Firebase Cloud
- Maps --> Google maps
- Design pattern --> Clean architecture

## Design:

only simple UI my main focus was on the logic and using Google maps and clean architecture and Firbase services.
